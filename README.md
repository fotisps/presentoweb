## Overview

This is a testing project aimed at showcasing the power of AI in coding, specifically using Bolt AI to build a
responsive website. The website is built using React and utilizes Glassmorphism design elements.

### _Responsiveness_

This website has been designed to be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across various
devices and screen sizes.

*   The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen widths, providing an intuitive user experience.
*   All elements, including typography, buttons, and images, are carefully crafted to ensure a consistent look and
feel regardless of the device used.

### _Glassmorphism_

The website incorporates Glassmorphism design elements, which create a sense of depth and visual interest. This
technique involves using transparent backgrounds and subtle gradient effects to create a sense of luminosity.

*   The use of glassmorphism enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of the website.
*   It creates a modern and premium look that sets this project apart from traditional web design approaches.
